          <strong>Project Summary:</strong>
          Scholars of political science and international relations use the
          scientific method to evaluate political phenomena in a variety of
          settings, which cuts across language and cultural barriers.
          Understanding the complex interactions of political institutions and
          human behavior is a complicated endeavor in all societies, yet it is
          even more challenging given the effects of partisanship and ideology
          that accompany both faculty and students into the classroom. Taking an
          empirical approach to the study of politics gives us leverage to
          explain the world around us, and the marketable skills we cultivate in
          our students are numerous (e.g., critical thinking, applied learning,
          and problem solving). In this paper, we analyze the results of a
          unique survey instrument that measures the perceptions of the field of
          political science and international relations and our own delivery of
          such a curriculum among students at UNCW and IIUI. In addition, we
          evaluate students’ awareness and attitudes of current events within
          the United States and Pakistan. In a world of increased globalization,
          our research offers suggestions to improve the quality of instruction,
          increase the substantive knowledge of our students regarding global
          politics, and encourage cross-cultural dialog built upon the universal
          language of the scientific study of politics.

          <strong>Title:</strong>
          Developing a Case Management Database for the RESET Program

          <strong>Project Summary:</strong>
          Reentry Systems of Effective Treatment (RESET), a criminal justice
          program for women with co-occurring disorders at Coastal Horizons
          Center, Inc. (CHC), was implemented within New Hanover County in May
          2015 through a grant from the Bureau of Justice Assistance. While the
          program has seen much success, a major challenge facing RESET, as well
          as other programs of this type, is the lack of a reliable and useful
          case management database. To this end, the current project seeks to
          assist RESET with the development and implementation of a case
          management database, which will greatly improve the program’s
          efficiency, functionality and effectiveness. Through an
          interdisciplinary collaboration, Drs. Lanier and DeVall, and Brandon
          Harris, a graduate student in computer science, will work with CHC,
          the community partner, to develop and implement a database for the
          RESET program.
